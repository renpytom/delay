Delay - README file
===================

Tom Rothamel <tom@onegeek.org>

This program implements a way to implement a delay with feedback to the 
user. It supports a configurable output message, and tries to keep the 
timing precise. 

Please read the INSTALL file for information on how to compile and 
install this program. Once installed, 'man delay' should display 
information on how to use the program.

The parsetimel.l and parsetimey.y files were taken from the files 
parsetime.l and parsetime.y (respectively) from the at-3.1.7 distribution,
which was authored by Thomas Koenig and David Parsons. These files are
used to implement the "delay until" feature. 

Thanks are due to:

 - Gianmarco Giovannelli <gmarco@giovannelli.it>
	For maintaining a FreeBsd port of delay, and working with me on
	resolving a few compatibility issues.
 - Tomi Ollila <Tomi.Ollila@tfi.net>
	For suggesting many of the features added to version 1.2, and
	helping with Solaris compatiblity.
 - Zachary P. Landau <kapheine@www.annex.org> 
	For suggesting giving delay the ability to run a command, 
	which was added in version 1.3.
