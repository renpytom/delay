How to install delay
====================

Delay's install procedure is quite simple, due to the use of autoconf. To
compile it, simply run the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Please note that you probably want to be root for that last command, as by
default it attempts to install in /usr/local/bin/.

./configure takes quite a few options, please read the file INSTALL.autoconf
for all of the gory details.
